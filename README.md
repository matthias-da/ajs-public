All style files contained in the zip file guidelinesAJS.zip are published under the GPL-2 licence. 
Modifications of the original source (jss) are carried out by Matthias Templ.

This zip-archive contains the pdfLaTeX infrastructure for
publications in the Journal of Statistical Software. The files  
  - ajs.cls (LaTeX2e class)
  - ajs.bst (BibTeX style)
need to be included in your search path (local working directory,
texmf or localtexmf tree).

A manual how to use jss.cls is provided in
  - templates-guidelinesAJS.pdf


AJS papers should be prepared using AJS styles. Submit only the PDF for review. 
The final version - after review - needs to include the full sources (.tex, .bib, and
all graphics). More information is included in the guidelines as well as a quick check.
